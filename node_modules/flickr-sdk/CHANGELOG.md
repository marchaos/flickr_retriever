## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet!

## [v3.8.0] - 2018-12-12

### Fixed

- [#122] Dedupe items in the "extras" param if passed as a string, array, or set. ([@pdokas])
- [#129] Clean `undefined` oauth params from the base string. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.7.0] - 2018-02-14

This release fixes a bug in the client-side build of the SDK where CORS preflight requests weren't being honored by the Flickr API. Big ups to [@ebisbe] and [@baohouse] for their help uncovering this issue in our client.

#### Fixed

- [#121] Browser REST client should request `text/plain` even though it gets back `application/json` ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.6.0] - 2018-01-23

This release adds support for passing in `extras` as a Set, which is semantically exactly what the Flickr REST API expects.

#### Added

- [#119] `extras` can now be passed in as a Set ([@pdokas])

## [v3.5.0] - 2017-11-02

Yay open source! This release upgrades superagent to [v3.8.0](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/releases/tag/v3.8.0), which includes [a patch](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/pull/1291) to allow for more control over response errors.

#### Removed

- [#118] Removed custom JSON parsers in favor of throwing in superagent's `.ok()` callback ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.4.0] - 2017-10-04

**Huge** shout out to [@ebisbe] for letting us know that the REST client was [super broken in the browser](https://github.com/flickr/flickr-sdk/issues/111). This release fixes that!

#### Fixed

- [#113] Updated link to webpack site ([@christianhg])
- [#116] Fixed extremely broken REST API parser for the browser ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.3.0] - 2017-09-19

We've removed the `X-Flickr-API-Method` header from our REST API client because it doesn't work in the browser. Our bad!

#### Removed

- [#110] Removed the `X-Flickr-API-Method` introduced in [#64]. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.2.0] - 2017-08-24

Starting with this release, there will be a browser-ready `flickr-sdk.js` file in the module root that can be used out-of-the-box. This file is not minified and does not support OAuth authentication for Upload, Replace, or REST API calls. If you need any further customization for your client-side app, we recommend using the client-side module bundler of your choice.

#### Added

- [#109] Build a standalone version for the browser with each new npm release. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.1.1] - 2017-08-22

Forgot to remove the "next" tag and npm makes it __SUPER DIFFICULT__ to unpublish modules, so here's a patch release that removes the tag and makes this the go-forward default release track!

## [v3.1.0] - 2017-08-22

#### Changed

- [#104] Upload/Replace services now parse the response body. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.0.0-alpha.6] - 2017-08-08

#### Added

- [#90] Replace service! ([@jeremyruppel])
- [#94] You can pass your Flickr API key as a string to the REST service constructor instead of providing an auth superagent plugin. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.0.0-alpha.5] - 2017-07-19

#### Changed

- [#69] Feeds responses are now JSON by default. They used to have the JSONP wrapper. ([@jeremyruppel])

#### Added

- [#72] Added an OAuth plugin factory method and an example of how to use it in an OAuth flow. ([@jeremyruppel])
- [#73] Added an OAuth helper method for generating the OAuth authorize url. ([@jeremyruppel])
- [#80] Upload service! ([@jeremyruppel])
- [#85] Added a static method to create OAuth plugins. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.0.0-alpha.4] - 2017-06-12

#### Added

- [#64] REST API calls will now always have the `X-Flickr-API-Method` header added. This isn't required to use the API, it's just a convenience header for downstream plugins. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.0.0-alpha.3] - 2017-06-07

Nothing super important!

## [v3.0.0-alpha.2] - 2017-06-07

#### Removed

- [#62] OAuth 1.0 is not supported in the browser. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v3.0.0-alpha.1] - 2017-06-07

#### Added

- [#55] For all REST API methods, you can pass `extras` as an Array and it will be formatted properly for the API. ([@jeremyruppel])

#### Removed

- [#58] Upgrade to latest [superagent] and remove support for node <4. ([@jeremyruppel])

## [v2.1.0] - 2017-05-09

#### Fixed

- [#56] Fixed `flickrTransport` being undefined in the browser. ([@smoogly])

#### Added

- [#57] Added a method for `getPhotoSizesByID`. ([@smoogly])

## v3.0.0 aka The Schismâ„¢ - 2016-10-27

This "release" marks the start of a complete rewrite of the Flickr SDK. Once the major release is ready, `master` will point to the new timeline and the `2.x` branch will point to the previous version.

> This version was published to npm by mistake and shouldn't be used.

#### Removed

- [#18] EVERYTHING. ([@jeremyruppel])
