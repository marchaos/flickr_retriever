## Install

```
npm install pino --save
```

If you need support for Node.js v0.12 or v0.10, please install the latest 2.x release using the `legacy` tag:

```
npm install pino@legacy --save
```

Documentation for the legacy version 2.x is available on the [`v2.x.x` branch](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/tree/v2.x.x).

## Usage

```js
'use strict'

var pino = require('pino')()

pino.info('hello world')
pino.error('this is at error level')
pino.info('the answer is %d', 42)
pino.info({ obj: 42 }, 'hello world')
pino.info({ obj: 42, b: 2 }, 'hello world')
pino.info({ obj: { aa: 'bbb' } }, 'another')
setImmediate(function () {
  pino.info('after setImmediate')
})
pino.error(new Error('an error'))

var child = pino.child({ a: 'property' })
child.info('hello child!')

var childsChild = child.child({ another: 'property' })
childsChild.info('hello baby..')

```

This produces:

```

`fastTime` mode switched on.

<a name="transports"></a>
## Transports

A transport in most logging libraries is something that runs in-process to
perform some operation with the finalized log line. For example, a transport
might send the log line to a standard syslog server after processing the log
line and reformatting it. For details on implementing, and some already written,
transports, see our [Transports⇗](docs/transports.md) document.

> **Pino *does not* natively support in-process transports.**

Pino does not support in-process transports because Node processes are
single threaded processes (ignoring some technical details). Given this
restriction, one of the methods Pino employs to achieve its speed is to
purposefully offload the handling of logs, and their ultimate destination, to
external processes so that the threading capabilities of the OS can be
used (or other CPUs).

One consequence of this methodology is that "error" logs do not get written to
`stderr`. However, since Pino logs are in a parseable format, it is possible to
use tools like [pino-tee][pino-tee] or [jq][jq] to work with the logs. For
example, to view only logs marked as "error" logs:

```
$ node an-app.js | jq 'select(.level == 50)'
```

In short, the way Pino generates logs:

1. Reduces the impact of logging on your application to an extremely minimal amount.
2. Gives greater flexibility in how logs are processed and stored.

Given all of the above, Pino clearly promotes out-of-process log processing.
However, it is possible to wrap Pino and perform processing in-process.
For an example of this, see [pino-multi-stream][pinoms].

<a name="browser"></a>
## Pino in the browser

Pino is compatible with [`browserify`](http://npm.im) for browser side usage:

This can be useful with isomorphic/universal JavaScript code.

By default, in the browser,
`pino` uses corresponding [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) `console` methods (`console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, `console.debug`, `console.trace`) and uses `console.error` for any `fatal` level logs.

### Browser Options

Pino can be passed a `browser` object in the options object,
which can have the following properties: 

#### `asObject` (Boolean)

```js
var pino = require('pino')({browser: {asObject: true}})
```

The `asObject` option will create a pino-like log object instead of
passing all arguments to a console method, for instance:

```js
pino.info('hi') // creates and logs {msg: 'hi', level: 30, time: <ts>}
```

When `write` is set, `asObject` will always be `true`.

#### `write` (Function | Object)

Instead of passing log messages to `console.log` they can be passed to
a supplied function.

If `write` is set to a single function, all logging objects are passed
to this function.

```js
var pino = require('pino')({browser: {write: (o) => {
  // do something with o
}}})
```

If `write` is an object, it can have methods that correspond to the
levels. When a message is logged at a given level, the corresponding
method is called. If a method isn't present, the logging falls back
to using the `console`.


```js
var pino = require('pino')({browser: {write: {
  info: function (o) {
    //process info log object
  },
  error: function (o) {
    //process error log object
  }
}}})
```

#### `serialize`: (Boolean | Array)

The serializers provided to `pino` are ignored by default in the browser, including
the standard serializers provided with Pino. Since the default destination for log
messages is the console, values such as `Error` objects are enhanced for inspection, 
which they otherwise wouldn't be if the Error serializer was enabled.

We can turn all serializers on, 

```js
var pino = require('pino')({
  browser: {
    serialize: true
  }
})
```

Or we can selectively enable them via an array:

```js
var pino = require('pino')({
  serializers: {
    custom: myCustomSerializer,
    another: anotherSerializer
  },
  browser: {
    serialize: ['custom']
  }
})
// following will apply myCustomSerializer to the custom property,
// but will not apply anotherSerizlier to another key
pino.info({custom: 'a', another: 'b'})  
```

When `serialize` is `true` the standard error serializer is also enabled (see https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/API.md#stdSerializers).
This is a global serializer which will apply to any `Error` objects passed to the logger methods.

If `serialize` is an array the standard error serializer is also automatically enabled, it can
be explicitly disabled by including a string in the serialize array: `!stdSerializers.err`, like so:

```js
var pino = require('pino')({
  serializers: {
    custom: myCustomSerializer,
    another: anotherSerializer
  },
  browser: {
    serialize: ['!stdSerializers.err', 'custom'] //will not serialize Errors, will serialize `custom` keys
  }
})
```

The `serialize` array also applies to any child logger serializers (see https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/API.md#discussion-2
for how to set child-bound serializers).

Unlike server pino the serializers apply to every object passed to the logger method,
if the `asObject` option is `true`, this results in the serializers applying to the
first object (as in server pino).      

For more info on serializers see https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/API.md#parameters.

#### `transmit` (Object)

An object with `send` and `level` properties.

The `transmit.level` property specifies the minimum level (inclusive) of when the `send` function
should be called, if not supplied the `send` function be called based on the main logging `level`
(set via `options.level`, defaulting to `info`). 

The `transmit` object must have a `send` function which will be called after 
writing the log message. The `send` function is passed the level of the log 
message and a `logEvent` object. 

The `logEvent` object is a data structure representing a log message, it represents
the arguments passed to a logger statement, the level 
at which they were logged and the heirarchy of child bindings. 

The `logEvent` format is structured like so: 

```js
{ 
  ts = Number,
  messages = Array, 
  bindings = Array, 
  level: { label = String, value = Number}
}
```

The `ts` property is a unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds, the time is taken from the moment the
logger method is called.

The `messages` array is all arguments passed to logger method, (for instance `logger.info('a', 'b', 'c')`
would result in `messages` array `['a', 'b', 'c']`).

The `bindings` array represents each child logger (if any), and the relevant bindings. 
For instance given `logger.child({a: 1}).child({b: 2}).info({c: 3})`, the bindings array 
would hold `[{a: 1}, {b: 2}]` and the `messages` array would be `[{c: 3}]`. The `bindings`
are ordered according to their position in the child logger heirarchy, with the lowest index
being the top of the heirarchy.

By default serializers are not applied to log output in the browser, but they will *always* be
applied to `messages` and `bindings` in the `logEvent` object. This allows us to ensure a consistent 
format for all values between server and client.

The `level` holds the label (for instance `info`), and the corresponding numerical value 
(for instance `30`). This could be important in cases where client side level values and 
labels differ from server side.

The point of the `send` function is to remotely record log messages: 

```js
var pino = require('pino')({
  browser: {
    transmit: {
      level: 'warn',
      send: function (level, logEvent) {
        if (level === 'warn') {
          // maybe send the logEvent to a separate endpoint
          // or maybe analyse the messages further before sending
        }
        // we could also use the `logEvent.level.value` property to determine
        // numerical value
        if (logEvent.level.value >= 50) { // covers error and fatal

          // send the logEvent somewhere 
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

<a name="caveats"></a>
## Caveats

There's some fine points to be aware of, which are a result of worthwhile trade-offs:

### 11 Arguments

The logger functions (e.g. `pino.info`) can take a maximum of 11 arguments.

If you need more than that to write a log entry, you're probably doing it wrong.

### Duplicate Keys

It's possible for naming conflicts to arise between child loggers and
children of child loggers.

This isn't as bad as it sounds, even if you do use the same keys between
parent and child loggers Pino resolves the conflict in the sanest way.

For example, consider the following:

```js
var pino = require('pino')
var fs = require('fs')
pino(fs.createWriteStream('./my-log'))
  .child({a: 'property'})
  .child({a: 'prop'})
  .info('howdy')
```

```sh
$ cat my-log
{"pid":95469,"hostname":"MacBook-Pro-3.home","level":30,"msg":"howdy","time":1459534114473,"a":"property","a":"prop","v":1}
```

Notice how there's two key's named `a` in the JSON output. The sub-childs properties
appear after the parent child properties. This means if we run our logs through `pino -t` (or convert them to objects in any other way) we'll end up with one `a` property whose value corresponds to the lowest child in the hierarchy:

```sh
$ cat my-log | pino -t
{"pid":95469,"hostname":"MacBook-Pro-3.home","level":30,"msg":"howdy","time":"2016-04-01T18:08:34.473Z","a":"prop","v":1}
```

This equates to the same log output that Bunyan supplies.

One of Pino's performance tricks is to avoid building objects and stringifying
them, so we're building strings instead. This is why duplicate keys between
parents and children will end up in log output.
